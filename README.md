# MIDAS Community Review of COVID-19 IFR Estimates
The [MIDAS community](https://midasnetwork.us/) aims to establish a scientifically grounded range of values for COVID-19 Infection Fatality Rates (IFR). Many publications list IFR estimates, but not all are based on rigorous scientific methods and data sources. The [MIDAS Coordination Center](https://midasnetwork.us/mcc/) will list published IFR estimates in this repository and is asking community members to review published estimates for strengths and weaknesses. 

The community IFR review will start informally. When the data allow, we will transition and formalize the project into an ongoing meta-analysis of IFR estimates. This project depends on community members for review of published estimates and all reviewers will be acknowledged and included as co-authors in any publications that would result from this project. 

All data and information from this repository can be used under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), which allows re-use of the data with appropriate attribution. 

## Reviews
We invite any MIDAS member to contribute to the reviews. The [MIDAS Coordination Center](https://midasnetwork.us/mcc/) may invite reviewers as needed. If you are not a MIDAS member, but your work is in alignment with the MIDAS [mission](https://midasnetwork.us/mission/) and [vision](https://midasnetwork.us/about/), feel free to [request membership](https://midasnetwork.us/midas-membership/) or contribute to the reviews as non-member. 

All IFR estimates found in the published literature are listed below, with their review status. Please select studies that need review to complete it. Studies listed below link to study details that can help with the review. Completed reviews will be posted on the study detail pages.
